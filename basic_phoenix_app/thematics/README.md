# Thematics

A basic CRUD application with a bit more flair. This app utilizes RESTful routes for updating a single resource (the Theme), as well as a some plugs and advanced logic for things like filtering results, setting session data, and validating database entries.

The end result is a basic application that allows you to create themes with different combinations of hex codes, and then activate themes which results in the entire webpage being rendered in the colors of the newly created theme.

**NOTE** -> This was build using Phoenix 1.2, which was pretty significantly different from Phoenix 1.3 and up.
