# Rapid Reps

## What are Rapid Reps?

On November 5, 2018, I decided to add a new habit into my daily routine. Something I have since come to call "Rapid Reps."

The idea was simple. Come up with one repetitive programming task (like integrating Travis CI, or building a basic CRUD app), and repeat that entire task every morning for an entire week (with one off day), trying to complete as much from memory as possible.

This has helped me learn new technologies at a much faster pace than I used to by helping me memorize the general workflow required to set up the technology, as well as introducing me to some of the most common errors early on and forcing me to learn how to fix them and avoid them in the future.

So far, I have completed one weeks worth of Rapid Reps for each of the following tasks:

1. Creating a basic REST application with CRUD actions for a single resource type in Phoenix.
2. Integrating OAuth sign in with Ueberauth in Phoenix.
3. Setting up a single-service Docker application locally.
4. Setting up a multi-service local Docker application with a Rails API and a Nuxt web interface (and connecting the two together).
5. Deploying a single container React application to Elastic Beanstalk.
6. Deploying a multi container application to Elastic Beanstalk.
7. Setting up an Elastic Beanstalk app with RDS.
8. Setting up an Elastic Beanstalk app with ElastiCache.
9. Setting up HTTPS on Elastic Beanstalk.
10. Setting up authentication with JWT on a Rails / Nuxt app.
11. Deploying a Rails app to Elastic Beanstalk
12. Deploying a Rails / Nuxt / Nginx app to Elastic Beanstalk.


## What is the purpose of this Repository?

This repository is basically a place for me to store some of the best code I've written during my Rapid Reps.

It's mainly for personal use since I find myself frequently using certain R2 (rapid repetition) projects for reference when completing similar tasks, and I'd like to make sure I always have access to them even if I lose this computer.
