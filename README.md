# Rapid Repetitions


## What are Rapid Repetitions?

On November 5, 2018, I decided to add a new habit into my daily routine. Something I have since come to call "Rapid Repetitions."

The idea was simple. I come up with one repetitive programming task (like integrating Travis CI, or building a basic CRUD app), and I repeat the entire task every morning for six days a week, trying to complete as much from memory as possible.

This has helped me rapidly learn new technologies by helping me memorize the general workflow behind setting up the technology, as well as introducing me to some of the most common errors early on and forcing me to learn how to fix them and avoid them in the future.

So far, I have completed one weeks worth of Rapid Repetitions for each of the following tasks:

1. Creating a basic REST application with CRUD actions for a single resource in Phoenix.
2. Integrating OAuth sign in with Ueberauth in Phoenix.
3. Setting up a basic local Docker application environment.
4. Setting up a multi-service local Docker application with a Rails API and a Nuxt web interface.
5. Deploying a single container React application to Elastic Beanstalk.
6. Deploying a multi container application to Elastic Beanstalk.
