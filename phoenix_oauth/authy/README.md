# Authy

This is a sample application showcasing OAuth integration with Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub in the Phoenix Framework. To get started, clone this repository, and then complete the following steps:

1. Install dependencies
2. Replace variables in .env.sh with your own client and secret keys (this assumes you have already set them up with the individual providers)
3. Migrate the database.
4. Run the server and test it out!
